Known Limitations:
- Our code does not handle sequence commands as that was not in test-p-ok.sh or test-p-bad.sh

Extra features:
- Our code implements two stacks using Linked Lists - one for commands and one for operators. 
- The algorithm for the stacks used was the suggested algorithm from class.
- We first read in the whole file into a dynamically allocated buffer.
- command_stream is a struct that contains a pointer to a command and a pointer to the next command_stream
